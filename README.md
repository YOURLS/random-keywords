#Simple Random Keywords & Charset


Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org)

##Description
Allows a simple override for the charset and creates random links. Does *not* still uses the sequential incrementing
(ie does start this out with a fixed lenght ALA https://github.com/YOURLS/random-keywords). 
It does not mess with existing links created or custom links, only new randomly generated.
Link length and character set are user-controlled via an admin interface.

##Installation
1. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `simplerandomcharset`.
2. Drop these files in that directory.
3. Go to the Plugins administration page ( *eg* `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php` ) and activate the plugin.
4. Go to the Random Charset administration page ( *eg* `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php?page=prb_simple_random_charset` ) to configure
5. Have fun!
