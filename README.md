#Simple Random Charset


Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org)

##Description
Allows a simple override for the charset and creates random links. Does *not* still uses the sequential incrementing
(ie does start this out with a fixed lenght ALA https://github.com/YOURLS/random-keywords). 
It does not mess with existing links created or custom links, only new randomly generated.
Link length and character set are user-controlled via an admin interface.

1. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `simplerandomcharset`.

5. Have fun!
